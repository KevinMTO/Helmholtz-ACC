# HPC Hybrid Programming Simulation Project

## Project Overview
This project focused on optimizing a memory-bound scientific code for multi-GPU clusters. The work was initially conducted during a 3-month internship at Technische Universit√§t Wien for the VSC Research Center. It is now being continued and improved as a personal hobby project.

## Project Details
- **Initial Duration**: July 2020 - September 2020 (3 months internship)
- **Department**: Originally a remote internship,VSC Research Center (during internship)

## Technical Stack
- CUDA
- OpenACC
- C
- Bash
- NVIDIA GPUs

## Original Project Goals
1. Optimize memory consumption of the Jacobi iterative solver.
2. Reduce communication time in multi-GPU environments.
3. Port the existing code to run efficiently on a multi-GPU cluster.

## Key Achievements
- Successfully ported the code to a multi-GPU cluster.
- Explored and implemented various optimization techniques.
- Improved both memory usage and inter-GPU communication efficiency.

## Environment
The project was initially developed and tested on a supercomputer equipped with multi-GPU nodes featuring NVIDIA GPUs.

## Future Work
This project is being actively improved as a hobby project. Some areas of focus include:
- Further optimization of GPU memory usage
- Implementing advanced "modern" parallelization techniques
- Exploring new applications for the optimized code
- Improving documentation and adding examples
