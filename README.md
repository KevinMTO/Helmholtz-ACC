## Project Details
- **Initial Duration**: July 2020 - September 2020 (3 months internship)
- **Current Status**: Ongoing hobby project
- **Type**: Originally a remote internship, now a personal GitHub project
- **Institution**: Technische Universität Wien (during internship)
- **Department**: VSC Research Center (during internship)

## Technical Stack
- CUDA
- OpenACC
- C
- Bash
- NVIDIA GPUs

## Project Goals
1. Optimize memory consumption of the prototypical scientific code
2. Reduce communication time in multi-GPU environments
3. Port the existing code to run efficiently on a multi-GPU cluster
4. Continuously improve and expand the project's capabilities

## Key Achievements
- Successfully ported the code to a multi-GPU cluster
- Explored and implemented various optimization techniques
- Improved both memory usage and inter-GPU communication efficiency

## Environment
The project was initially developed and tested on a supercomputer equipped with multi-GPU nodes featuring NVIDIA GPUs.

## Future Work
This project is being actively improved as a hobby project. Some areas of focus include:
